# Coding Standards

<p class="lead">This site contains a set of guidelines we use to bring our projects to a good end. TODO - Do something here that ties into our values and mission.</p>

The contents of this site exist for ourselves—more importantly, our future selves—and for giving future collegues a reference to our way of doing things and their quirks. The guidelines cover workflow, code style, and other little things we consider worth documenting.

All pages are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/coding-standards), so edits and improvements are welcome. Note that these are our own opinionated ideas, so we'll be finicky when it comes to substantial changes.
